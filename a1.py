MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience 
with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover: > - Variables
 and basic data types > - Conditionals (if/elif/else) > - Loops (for and
 while) > - Functions > - Basic list operations > > Make them
 progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear
 instructions and example inputs/outputs.

# Problem 1: Favorite Number

# Instructions:
# Create a variable called name and assign it your name.
# Create a variable called favorite_number and assign it your favorite number.
# Print the message:
# "Hi, my name is <name> and my favorite number is <favorite_number>."

# Example Output:
# Hi, my name is Taylor and my favorite number is 42.

# Problem 2: Temperature Check

# Instructions:
# Ask the user to enter the temperature (in Â°F).
# Then, print a message based on the temperature:
# - Below 50: "It's cold!"
# - 50 to 80: "Nice weather."
# - Above 80: "It's hot!"

# Example Input/Output:
# Enter the temperature: 72
# Nice weather.

PROBLEM 3: Print Even Numbers
Topic: Loops (for loop)
Instructions:
Write a program that prints all even numbers from 2 to n

PROBLEM 4: Factorial Calculator
[Copy the complete problem description from your AI assistant]

Instructions:
Write a function factorial(n) that returns the factorial of a 
non-negative integer n using a while loop. The factorial of 0 is 1.

PROBLEM 5: List Average
Topic: Basic list operations and functions
Instructions:
Write a function average(numbers) that takes a list of
