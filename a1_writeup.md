# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
    I found Python to be much simpler and intuitive to learn, however with any new coding language there was a learning curve. I found it more powerful and capable than Java which I have used previously. 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
    I was having issues with chat not giving me questions that I could use my past knowledge for, however I rememebered to include my past experience in CSA and it was able to give me questions that gradually transitioned from CSA type questions to python. 

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
    The concept that was most challenging for me was iterating through lists as it was just such a different format to learn. AI helped as it was able to explain how to transfer what I learned in CSA to Python.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
    I learned a lot about collaborating with AI, namely, I need to ask it specific questions about specific issues I have so that it can better understand and explain my questions.
